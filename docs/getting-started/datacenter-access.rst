In our effort to provide customers a Fanatical Experience®, every Rackspace
customer is provided a dedicated implementation leader to guide you through the
implementation process. The implementation leader will contact you directly and
let you know when the colocation environment will be ready to accommodate your
deployment. Together, you will establish a move-in date for your colocation
deployment and the implementation leader will serve as primary liaison between
you and the data center operations team.
