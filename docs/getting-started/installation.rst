Installation
============

The customer will coordinate deliveries with Rackspace Inventory and be
responsible for receiving, unpacking, and moving their equipment into the DC
(see Shipping, Receiving, and Inventory Services) unless they pay for Smart
Hands for installation as part of their initial contract. Any vendor or customer
supplied cabinets being installed must be secured and get final approval by DC
Facility Engineering.

During the customer installation Rackspace will provide contact information for
an onsite POC to answer questions and provide guidance and technical assistance
as needed.  Any requests for assistance with the installation of customer gear
should be submitted as a Smart Hands request.
