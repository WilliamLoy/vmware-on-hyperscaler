RackConnect® Global is a software defined multi-cloud interconnection platform
that links Rackspace customers with other Rackspace data centers, third-party

virtual connections.


Key features of RackConnect Global include the following:

- Multicloud flexibility: Spin up essentially infinite virtual connections over
  one physical connection as needed.

- IT unification: Establish a cohesive private environment over the proprietary
  Rackspace Technology backbone that links all your IT applications.

- Expanded reach: Broaden your edge by harnessing the power of Megaport and the
