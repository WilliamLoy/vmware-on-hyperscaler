Blended bandwidth for Rackspace Colocation
==========================================

Blended bandwidth customers leverage the same sophisticated network that powers
the Rackspace Technology best-in-class managed hosting and cloud offerings. We
enhance user experience by automatically routing traffic to the carrier offering
the lowest latency and highest quality of service. And we adhere to the highest
network security standards, with global teams monitoring network activity
24x7x365 to anticipate interruptions and mitigate threats.

Currently available in all Rackspace data centers with colocation across North
America, Europe and Asia Pacific, Rackspace Blended Bandwidth offers:

**Protected circuits:** Every connection comes with dual connections for
redundancy.

**95th-Percentile burstable billing:** Because traffic patterns can be
unpredictable, Rackspace doesn’t charge for the top 5% of traffic surges.

**Security and Compliance:** Our multi-layered approach to network security
meets the strictest standards — including ISO 27002 and 27001, PCI DSS, SSAE16,
SOC 1, 2 and 3, Privacy Shield, and the Content Protection and Security
Standard.

**DDoS mitigation:** Available as a subscription service for proactive
protection to identify malicious traffic with the first hostile packet, or as an
on-demand service that can be activated if a security event is underway.

**Control:** Access to full routing tables to facilitate granular traffic
management.

**IPs:** One IP included per colocated device, up to 16 devices; additional IP 
packages available up to /22 (1024 IPs).
